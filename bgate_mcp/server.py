"""Builders Gate MCP server (FastMCP, stdio).

Every tool resolves the project from BGATE_ROOT or the cwd by walking up for a
.bgate dir, so an agent working inside a game repo never passes paths around.

Tool errors return a dict with an "error" key rather than raising: a raised
exception inside a tool call reads to the model as a broken server, while an
error payload reads as a fact it can act on.
